### **P.S.** suggestion

It spends me almost 7 days of waiting unlock the assets. I think wait to unlock assets from layer 2 cannot be satisfied to layer1 users. I hope there maybe can have some auto unlock assets bot (like liquidation bot) which can get some profit. Auto unlock assets can surely improve UX on L2 -> L1.
